## gas-httpserver
**A *really jank* basic HTTP server library written for the [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) platform, designed for building simple backends**

## Getting started
### Using gas-httpserver
*This code section is intentionally left blank due to a major refactor in the code soon*

To test this, deploy the Google Apps Script project as a *Web Application*, and put the desired path after the `/exec` or `/dev` on the URL

## Improvements
*This is the temporary place for changelogs*

### v1.1
*plz make better later*
Refactored the whole library to feel more like Express.js, although not all of it (*shame-less copying*)
basically a whole lot of refactoring
